## Daegu Apartment Price Prediction Project

# Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate apartment prices in Daegu, South Korea. 
By leveraging machine learning techniques, we seek to understand the key factors influencing apartment prices and create a robust model for accurate price prediction. 
Accurate predictions help homeowners, real estate agents, and potential buyers make informed decisions.

# Business Problem
The real estate market is dynamic and highly influenced by various internal and external factors. 
Apartment owners and real estate agents often face challenges in determining the optimal listing price for apartments. Overpricing can deter potential buyers 
while underpricing can result in lost profits. This project aims to develop a model to predict apartment prices based on key features of the apartment and its surroundings.
